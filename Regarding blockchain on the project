Usage of the immutability of content on the blockchain is beyond-dout important for this project, the question is how and to what extent?

In general: the more successful the blockchain is (regarding the tech itself, ammount of active nodes, how active it's community is), the more the
Data stored on it is immutable and much more promising.

There are several ways to save information and to orgenize it as well, some cheaper and some more costly providing better access and better stability
These come in form of different blockchains, one could technically save the information on a bitcoin transaction, one could say this is the most stable
Blockchain in existence, while that might be true, there are two (major) issues with this approach:
1. Cost: in times of high traffic, sudden up-tics and other events, the service fee for making that transaction can rise to (in extreme cases) 30$
2. Accessibility: to keep track of the transactions holding the information, we would have to save the transaction unique ID, with that we would retrive
information from the blockchain, this is difficult and dis-automated on several levels, the ID could also be corrupted uppon transfer, changed purposely
by an attacker, rendering the information lost forever.
